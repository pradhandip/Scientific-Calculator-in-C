This project is a console-based scientific calculator implemented in C. It offers a wide range of mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithmic functions, and more.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Square, square root
- Factorial
- Logarithms (base 10 and natural logarithm)
- Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent)
- Inverse trigonometric functions (arc sine, arc cosine, arc tangent)
- Permutations and combinations
- Constants (Pi, e)

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/scientific-calculator-c.git`
2. Compile the source code: `gcc calculator.c -o calculator -lm` (Note: `-lm` is needed for the math library)
3. Run the executable: `./calculator`
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.
